tinker
======

Tinker is an android application containing a `film information` based search engine which allows
for an easy way of collapsing multiple search criteria in order to receive the common entries between them.

In essence, it allows one user to easily combine chains of film related topics (e.g actor-actor-actor..., film-film-film..)
in order to receive the `logical` common entries between these topics, i.e common films or common people.
